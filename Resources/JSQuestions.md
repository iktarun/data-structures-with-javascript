# Anmol Interview Questions on Pollyfills

I’ve given multiple frontend interviews at companies like Atlassian and Rippling, and one pattern stands out—writing polyfills is a must-know skill.

If you're preparing for frontend interviews, here’s a list of essential JavaScript and React polyfills you should practice:

🔹 JavaScript Polyfills
✅ bind() polyfill
✅ call() polyfill
✅ apply() polyfill
✅ Promise polyfill
✅ debounce() polyfill
✅ throttle() polyfill
✅ setTimeout polyfill
✅ setInterval polyfill
✅ map() polyfill
✅ filter() polyfill
✅ reduce() polyfill
✅ forEach() polyfill
✅ find() polyfill
✅ findIndex() polyfill
✅ some() polyfill
✅ every() polyfill
✅ flat() polyfill
✅ Object.create() polyfill
✅ Object.assign() polyfill
✅ JSON.stringify() polyfill
✅ JSON.parse() polyfill

⚛️ React-Specific Polyfills
🚀 useState polyfill
🚀 useEffect polyfill
🚀 useMemo polyfill
🚀 useCallback polyfill
🚀 useContext polyfill
🚀 useReducer polyfill
🚀 useRef polyfill
🚀 useLayoutEffect polyfill
🚀 useImperativeHandle polyfill

# what is AbortController?

💻 You will fail 😔 in frontend interviews if you aren’t solid with JavaScript-based coding problems.

After giving interviews at Atlassian Microsoft and Rippling — I’ve curated a list of must-solve frontend coding challenges and JS concepts that I wish I had focused on earlier.

👉 Segregated into easy, medium, and hard:

✅ Easy
Infinite currying
Clone deeply nested objects
Debouncing
Throttling
Call, apply, bind
Polyfill for map, filter, reduce
Event delegation
Shallow copy vs deep copy
Difference between setTimeout and setInterval
Event loop basics

✅ Medium
Promises.all, promises.allSettled
Promise chaining
Cache with time limit
https://lnkd.in/grJxDcN4
Memoize
https://lnkd.in/guF5raKQ
Flatten deeply nested array
https://lnkd.in/g8PSad_G
Nested array generator
https://lnkd.in/gDFEa5UG
Create your own bind method
Implement custom instanceof
Currying with placeholders
Debounce and throttle as reusable utility functions

✅ Hard
Promise time limit
https://lnkd.in/gsiDVskc
Execute asynchronous functions in parallel
https://lnkd.in/gGX8d8ia
Call function with custom context
https://lnkd.in/gj-rjJGd
Design cancellable function
https://lnkd.in/guRbU5Rk
Implement async/await using generators
Microtasks vs macrotasks (with practical examples)
Write your own event emitter
Custom promise implementation

🔥 Mastering these will give you an edge in every frontend round.
🚀 Save this post and start solving — consistency wins!

# 21 concepts I strongly suggest spend time revising before your upcoming Frontend Interviews:

Javascript Focussed concepts ⬇️

- Call Stack
- Execution Context
- Closures
- High Order Functions
- Spread & Rest Operators
- Promises, Async/Await
- IIFE Function Expressions
- Primitive Types, Reference Types
- Array Methods like Map, Reduce, Filter
- Function Scope, Block Scope, Lexical Scope
- Event Loop, Callback Queue, Microtask Queue
- setTimeout, setInterval, rAF
- Factories & ES6 Classes
- Comparison Checks == vs ===
- ‘this’ keyword, call, apply, bind functions
- ‘new’ keyword, Constructor, instanceof and Instances
- Prototype Inheritance and Prototype Chain
- Object.create & Object.assign
- Pure Functions, Side Effects, State Mutation
- Partial Applications, Currying, Compose, Pipe
