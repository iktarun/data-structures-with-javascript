A Redditor Who Landed a FAANG Job Spills the Ultimate Interview Hacks!

Step 1: Dodging the Application Black Hole

Skip the portals! ATS systems filter out most resumes.
Instead, I reached out directly to engineers and hiring managers on LinkedIn for referrals.
My message was short & sharp:
"Hey [Name], I'm really interested in [Team/Company] and would love to apply. I have [X years] of experience in [Relevant Skill], and I believe I'd be a great fit. Would you be open to referring me?"
Result? Multiple referrals in a week — straight to recruiter screens, no more waiting in the void.

Step 2: Studying Only What Matters

Forget solving 500 random LeetCode problems.
I reverse-engineered interview patterns using Glassdoor, Blind, and LeetCode forums.
Most companies repeat 10-15 core problems — so I focused on:

- Top 30 questions per company (sorted by frequency)
- Recognizing patterns, not just solutions ("Oh, this is just a sliding window problem with a twist.")
- Practiced mock interviews on Pramp and with friends for real-time feedback

Result? Solving questions in under 10 minutes, no brute-forcing needed.

Step 3: Mastering the Behavioral Interview

FAANG behavioral rounds aren’t about "personality" — they want structured answers.
I prepped 5 strong stories using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and adapted them as needed.
Pro Tip: Always highlight impact with metrics.

- Instead of: "I helped optimize a backend service."
- Say: "I optimized the backend, reduced latency by 40%, and saved $500K in cloud costs."

Hack: When asked about failure, spin it into a win — "I learned X, which led to Y success later."

Step 4: Using Hiring Process Loopholes

I timed my interviews so companies knew I had other offers — they moved faster.
Targeted hiring events and systems like Amazon’s bar-raisers (they can override bad interviewers).
Built a solid relationship with my recruiter — they can fast-track borderline candidates and help with negotiations.

Step 5: Crushing Offers & Negotiations

Got my first offer and used it as leverage to speed up other companies.
Played it cool — companies love candidates who seem in demand.
Negotiated hard:

- "I’m excited about this role, but my other offer is at $X — can you match or improve it?"
- "I was hoping for a higher base/signing bonus to align with market rates."

Result? An extra +$40K in total comp.

The Final Outcome

- FAANG offer with $300K+ total comp
- Less time wasted on pointless prep
- Lower stress, more control over the process

Work smarter, not harder. You’ve got this!

I regret losing a 70 LPA+ Offer 😔
Sharing my recent Interview Experience at Uber for the SDE-2 role:

I emailed the recruiter, and they shared a CodeSignal OA to proceed. Here’s what it and the other rounds included:
◼️ 𝐎𝐀: 4 questions covering DSA concepts. Though my score was slightly below expectations, I still got a chance to move forward.
◼️ 𝟏𝐬𝐭 𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 - 𝐃𝐒𝐀 (𝐄𝐥𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲): 3 questions – 2 on DP and 1 on DFS. Clearing this was crucial to proceed, and I made it through.
◼️ 𝟐𝐧𝐝 𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 - 𝐃𝐒𝐀 + 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐢𝐧𝐠: A BFS question with follow-ups. The expectation was to solve another question, but we ran out of time.
◼️ 𝟑𝐫𝐝 𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐝 - 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐃𝐞𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐧: Implement an in-memory Twitter-like system with multiple follow-ups.

I cracked UI 2 Engineer at MoEngage 🔥🎉
Here is my Honest Interview Experience of all rounds:

Recruiter reached out on LinkedIn sharing the Opportunity Details ✨

🔺 Round 1: Online Coding Assessment

- The test had around 25-30 questions with a mix of Javascript, React, and HTML questions.
- Had to read through the code snippets and predict the correct output. For some questions had to choose correct reasonings.

🔺 Round 2: Problem Solving (60 mins)

- It was mainly javascript oriented round and asked me to implement 2 JS problems.

1. Implement Debouncing.
2. Implement executing N callback based async tasks in series.

- Gave 10-15 very tricky output based questions on Javascript. I had to guess the correct output and share the reasonings of why.

🔺 Round 3: Design & React Round (90 mins)

- Asked how would I consider designing re-usable UI components. Later, picked Tabs component as an example asking to design (HLD like).
- Asked useState working & then to implement a simple polyfill version of useState.
- Asked about React Portals with live code on different ways of mounting a Modal/Dialog Component.

🔺 Round 4: Engineering Manager UI (60 mins)

- The Manager dived deep into my past projects at work. Asked tons of cross-questions on why not this approach.
- Interviewer was very much keen on assessing my behavioral & culture fitment asked tons of scenario based questions.
- The interview was truly tough but had my answers present.

# Arun M for Rubrik UI

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/arunm-engineer_interview-interviewexperience-collab-activity-7310871016296050688-Jhh-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABDvUZ0BScq84zwgkvzCRb-oJQBFbZMtrxs

I recently went through an interview experience at Rubrik offering an incredible 70 LPA+ package.

I got really happy seeing that email as I had a chance to get a SDE (UI) position with an incredible offer.

I was all prepared, and I want to share with you how that interview went like:

☑️ The first hurdle was a technical screening where the interviewer dug into my past projects and the tech I’ve worked with.

☑️ Then came the JavaScript round. The first question was to implement auto-retry promises, and the second was throttling promises by batching.

☑️ Next up was the UI Coding Round. I had to build a reusable Image Carousel in React and implement shuffle, previous, next, first, last, and also support navigation in circular loop all while keeping the component reusable.

I finished on time and thought I’d nailed it. But here’s where the story turns: I got rejected. 😓

All because I missed edge cases in the shuffle feature. And also focussed less on CSS design. That hit hard, knowing I was so close yet tripped over the small details.

This experience has taught me that you have to think through every “what if” during the interview. Those little details can be the difference between a yes and a no.
