A Redditor Who Landed a FAANG Job Spills the Ultimate Interview Hacks!

Step 1: Dodging the Application Black Hole

Skip the portals! ATS systems filter out most resumes.
Instead, I reached out directly to engineers and hiring managers on LinkedIn for referrals.
My message was short & sharp:
"Hey [Name], I'm really interested in [Team/Company] and would love to apply. I have [X years] of experience in [Relevant Skill], and I believe I'd be a great fit. Would you be open to referring me?"
Result? Multiple referrals in a week — straight to recruiter screens, no more waiting in the void.

Step 2: Studying Only What Matters

Forget solving 500 random LeetCode problems.
I reverse-engineered interview patterns using Glassdoor, Blind, and LeetCode forums.
Most companies repeat 10-15 core problems — so I focused on:

- Top 30 questions per company (sorted by frequency)
- Recognizing patterns, not just solutions ("Oh, this is just a sliding window problem with a twist.")
- Practiced mock interviews on Pramp and with friends for real-time feedback

Result? Solving questions in under 10 minutes, no brute-forcing needed.

Step 3: Mastering the Behavioral Interview

FAANG behavioral rounds aren’t about "personality" — they want structured answers.
I prepped 5 strong stories using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) and adapted them as needed.
Pro Tip: Always highlight impact with metrics.

- Instead of: "I helped optimize a backend service."
- Say: "I optimized the backend, reduced latency by 40%, and saved $500K in cloud costs."

Hack: When asked about failure, spin it into a win — "I learned X, which led to Y success later."

Step 4: Using Hiring Process Loopholes

I timed my interviews so companies knew I had other offers — they moved faster.
Targeted hiring events and systems like Amazon’s bar-raisers (they can override bad interviewers).
Built a solid relationship with my recruiter — they can fast-track borderline candidates and help with negotiations.

Step 5: Crushing Offers & Negotiations

Got my first offer and used it as leverage to speed up other companies.
Played it cool — companies love candidates who seem in demand.
Negotiated hard:

- "I’m excited about this role, but my other offer is at $X — can you match or improve it?"
- "I was hoping for a higher base/signing bonus to align with market rates."

Result? An extra +$40K in total comp.

The Final Outcome

- FAANG offer with $300K+ total comp
- Less time wasted on pointless prep
- Lower stress, more control over the process

Work smarter, not harder. You’ve got this!
