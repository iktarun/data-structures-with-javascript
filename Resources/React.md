# Arun M Expereince -----------------------------------------------------------

I faced the toughest Frontend interview of my career for SDE-2 role at PW (PhysicsWallah).

Honestly I did not expect this to be a Frontend System Design Round. It had not prepared hard from the System Design perspective as it was just Round 2.

The interviewer asked me to design a HLD of a scalable chat for a live streaming application like Youtube.

𝗡𝗼𝘁𝗲: Designing HLD of Chat for Live Streaming is very different from WhatsApp like Chat (very different kind of challenges).

What was supposed to be a 1-hour interview stretched to 2 hours as I was grilled with problem after problem 🤦‍♂️

We dove deep into topics like rendering performance, scalability, implementation approaches, trade-offs, and communication protocols.

The interviewer left no stone unturned, scrutinizing every technical detail with a strong focus on scalability 🚀

Some Questions I Encountered:

☑️ What does the state look like? Are all the messages added to single array? (note: single array is not scalable enough)

☑️ If 1000+ messages are broadcasted at once, will you update them all at once in the state?

☑️ How will you update the message sent time? Will you run an interval every second to check and update the time in state?

☑️ How will you load older chats efficiently? Is it ideal to use an Intersection Observer on each message to observe?

☑️ How will you control animations of live reactions (like, clap, fire) on messages? How will you control rendering reaction animations if 1000+ users reacted at same time?

Despite the challenges, I stayed calm and followed a structured & practical approach to solve the problems.

I regret losing a 80 LPA+ Offer 😔
Sharing my recent Interview Experience at Microsoft for the SDE-2 role with questions

☑️ Applied through LinkedIn: Saw a post from a hiring manager, reached out and got connected with the recruiter. That kicked off the process!
💻 Online Assessment: Had to fix 14-15 React bugs within an hour. Needed at least 60% accuracy to move forward. Time limit - 1 hour.
🔮 Round 1 (DSA): Solved a binary tree and binary search problem. Had to provide functional code.

- https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/solutions/1704641/monkey-know-binary-search/
- https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/description/

📐 Round 2 (LLD + Frontend): Built a table component, clarified requirements, and explained the flow. Got questions on Intersection Observer API, infinite scrolling, and React virtualization. Also had to code some parts.

Both rounds went well, but the position got closed, ending my journey. It was a big setback because I had been preparing for months. 🥲

# Anmol Agarwal

This problem was asked to me in my frontend interview Atlassian.

How to control a child component directly from the parent?
Like calling childRef.current.focus() on a custom input?

You will need to use useImperativeHandle hook for this.
It allows you to define what the parent can access via ref — essentially giving your child component a clean, controlled API.
This makes custom components feel like calling methods on a class instance, but in a React-friendly, functional way!

Let me know if you know any other way to solve this problem.
